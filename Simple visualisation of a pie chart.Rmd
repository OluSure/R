#I then tell r the subset are strings
str(subset_Species)
# I then create a tabe pointing it to a specific variable which is Species from my data iris
table.iris = table(iris$Species)  
table.iris 
 # Make a pie chart of it

# Set the plotplot 
#This would not show because am using a phone

#I then use a function called paris, to design the pie chart.
